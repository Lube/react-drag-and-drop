# React Drag and Drop

This library contains some very basic draggable and droppable components.

You probably want to use something more stable and feature rich like [react-dnd](https://github.com/gaearon/react-dnd).

## Install

```sh
npm install react-drag-and-drop
```

### Use

```js
import { Draggable, Droppable } from 'react-drag-and-drop'

```

enjoy
